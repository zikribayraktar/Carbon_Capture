# Carbon Capture Machine Learning Literature

Survey of all published Carbon Capture w/ ML papers, data, code and supplemental materials for the benefit of all humanity.

This repo came to life following the [Climate Change AI reading group](https://www.climatechange.ai/)'s work in early 2022. We reviewed some of the papers in our reading group discussions but felt the need to unify and centralize the ML based Carbon Capture literature, make it easily accessible with relevant code and data so that published works can be duplicated, verified and improved for the rest of us humans.
